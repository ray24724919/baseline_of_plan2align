I'm too lazy to let him know.\"\nShe looked at her beautiful face in the mirror, raised her lips, and raised a hint of a smile. In the previous few realms, the original owner's wishes were too soft, and this realm was more in line with her intentions.\nAnd behind her, the young man heard her words and was stunned. He heard what? The Three Princess who was eager to hang on Ye Mi Xin's body, said that she was too lazy to let people know her good qualities? The young man's face was extremely strange.\nHe had just spoken out of instinct, and his later comfort was also a bit of a flattery. In fact, the true Three Princess, who had no good qualities... She herself was praising herself, saying it with such confidence.\nBut... the girl in the mirror had a face that was unparalleled in beauty, with eyebrows and eyelashes that were the epitome of elegance, and was lazily playing with a gold hairpin, making people's hearts itch.
