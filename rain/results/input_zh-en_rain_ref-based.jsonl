Did you get any information?” The plum was worried in her heart, and the dream of awakening was finally short-lived and fleeting, only getting a partial glimpse of the ability.\nBut the information obtained is related to the difficulty of restoring the entire ability blueprint.\nStone Xiaobai replied, “I probably know what my ability is now.”\n“Really?” The plum was overjoyed, asking, “Tell me, what information did you get?” Stone Xiaobai said, “Power, I can get some power from others.”\nThe plum was taken aback, asking, “Huh? What else?”\nStone Xiaobai thought for a moment, shrugged, and said, “That’s it.”\nThe plum’s eyes widened, what does that mean?\nThe plum sighed, even though she didn’t expect the dream of awakening to get much information, but just getting a vague information, she was not prepared for it.\nCan get some power from others, this can be considered as an effect, so what are the conditions for getting power? Are there any restrictions on getting power from others?\nIn order to use one’s ability smoothly, one must be extremely clear about the three major rules of effect, conditions, and restrictions, and a complete ability blueprint is extremely important.\nStone Xiaobai’s information was only a small part of the iceberg, and even the iceberg was not even a small part.\nBut the plum knew", "reference": "Chapter 110: Strength comes from Oppai\n“Phew!” Shi Xiaobai exhaled the deep breath he had held in as he gradually opened up his eyes. The first thing he saw was Riko’s beautiful but nervous face.\n“How is it? How much information did you get?” Riko was feeling uneasy since the repeat of the awakening dream was brief. It only skimmed the surface, so the information gained about the superpower would be greatly lacking.\nHowever, the amount of information obtained would determine how difficult it was to reproduce the entire superpower blueprint.\nShi Xiaobai answered, “This King roughly knows what his superpower is.”\n“Really?” Riko was delighted as she asked, “Quick, tell me about the information you gathered.” Shi Xiaobai said, “Strength. This King can obtain the strength of others.”\nRiko was surprised as she asked, “Huh? Anymore?”\nShi Xiaobai cocked his head and gave it some thought before he threw up his hands and said, “That was it.”\nRiko stared widely. “What do you mean that was it?”\nRiko gave a faint sigh. Although she should not have expected to obtain much information from the repeat of the awakening dream, she had never expected that all he got was such vague information.\nTo be able to obtain powers from others meant that it was the effect, but what about the condition to obtain strength? What sort of limitations would there be to obtain strength from others?\nTo be able to use his superpower freely, he had to be extremely clear of the three rules, namely, effects, conditions and limitations. A complete superpower blueprint was extremely important.\nThe information Shi Xiaobai had obtained was just a tip of an iceberg, it might even not be able to amount to the tip of an iceberg.\nHowever, Riko knew it was not the time to grumble over this. It was all her fault, so she had to restore Shi Xiaobai’s perfect superpower blueprint or she would never feel at ease.\n“Do you know how to obtain powers from others? For example, must you do a specific move or do certain things?” Riko made an attempted guess.\nShi Xiaobai was momentarily taken aback before he pondered for a while. Then, he nodded and said, “This King seems to know how.”\nIndeed, he had a vague idea how to obtain the strength of others in his mind.\n“Really?” Riko was pleasantly surprised to hear this. As long as the method to use the superpower was known, she could figure out the superpower blueprint by constant experimentation. She hurriedly said, “Then quick give it a try! Well, you can use me as the target. Obtain your power from my body!”\nIt was actually a very dangerous thing to be the target of a superpower experiment. Only the Heavens knew what strength really meant. It was unknown if it would harm her body if her strength was taken away or if her strength could be restored or if the superpower could be returned.\nHowever, Riko could not care so much. She blamed herself for everything that had happened, so she believed she had the responsibility to become Shi Xiaobai’s experimental subject. She had to take responsibility for this matter, regardless of the price."}

Even though she told herself that she was willing to sacrifice herself, it was common for humans to fear the unknown.\nRiko closed her eyes with a bit of apprehension. She began cheering on herself in her mind. Come on, even if it will result in excruciating pain when strength is extracted, that is the responsibility you have to bear! Riko closed her eyes tightly as she held her breath. She nervously waited for Shi Xiaobai to use his superpower on her.\nSuddenly, Riko was horrified to find her perky, left breast being grabbed by someone! That holy ground of softness had been grabbed gently with five fingers making full contact with it. A numbness immediately spread throughout her body!\n“Ah!”Having her breast attacked, Riko gave out an instinctive yelp as she hurriedly jumped back and covered her chest with her hands. She stared in disbelief at Shi Xiaobai’s wandering hands that had yet retracted from its grip.\n“Why!?” Riko looked at a blinking Shi Xiaobai that had a completely pure expression. She could not believe that he had used such a shameless method to desecrate the holy land that no one else had ever touched!\nRiko’s face blushed red as her eyes began to slightly swell in redness. “I have always thought of you as a good person. I never expected you to be such a Shi Xiaobai!”\nRiko was both embarrassed and furious. Even if she had made a mistake, it was unintentional. Besides, she had been doing her best to make up for it. Why did he treat her like that? Why did he use such a humiliating way to take his revenge on her?\n“Strength!” Shi Xiaobai suddenly reached out his hand as he pointed at Riko’s covered chest. He calmly said, “Didn’t you allow This King to obtain strength from your body? Strength is in there!”\nUpon hearing this, Riko stood open-eyed and agape with speechless astonishment.

There was an ancient semi-enclosed bed there, carved with exquisite and complex patterns. It was covered with fine gauze, which vaguely outlined the lithe and graceful figure of a woman.\nAfter understanding the situation, Yu Chu’s heart was mixed with hope and fear. The good news was that this was a female-dominated society. Being a woman had many benefits in this world where women were superior to men.

His head was lowered as he nervously asked in a slightly husky voice, “Your Highness, you’re awake?”\nYu Chu looked up to size him up. She noticed that he was quite good-looking, with delicate features. His humble attitude made him appear very docile. On the one hand, he feared her but on the other hand, he proceeded with caution to please her. This is how it feels to be revered as a woman, huh?\nYu Chu secretly sucked in a deep breath. As she thought about the original host’s usual temperament, she half-leaned on the bed and lazily waved her hand. “You can leave.”\nThe young man froze. Typically speaking, when a noblewoman like her woke up, attendants had to stay there and wait upon them. Moreover, most noblewomen usually kept several likable attendants at their side to wait upon them and let them take care of all kinds of matters.\nIt was especially true for someone of noble status like the Third Imperial Princess, who led a dissipated life… Generally speaking, when it came to these women of noble status, not only did these attendants wait upon them, but it was also quite normal for these noblewomen to take some liberties with them. As the young man inexplicably got dismissed, he couldn’t help but raise his head and sweep a glance at the Third Imperial Princess on the bed.\nShe was half lying on the bed, her eyes slightly squinted.

Therefore, the men living in the Capital were avoiding her at all costs, and no one wanted to provoke her.\nThe young man was naturally nervous and helpless, thinking that he would be molested by the Third Imperial Princess again, but he didn’t consider escaping. After all, he was only a servant unlike those noble princes and noblemen, who had a choice to choose their own wives and masters.\nNormally, as servants, if they were favored by an Imperial Princess, they would do their best to curry favor with her.

The original host’s identity was very honorable in this female-dominated society. She was this dynasty’s Third Imperial Princess. It’s just that her character was poor, and she was a bit useless and dissolute… Other than this, she was still fine, I guess…\nThe Second Imperial Princess died early, so the Empress had only two daughters left, the Eldest Imperial Princess and Third Imperial Princess. She was relatively strict with the Eldest Imperial Princess, but spoiled her youngest daughter to the skies. The Empress was, thus, the Third Imperial Princess’ biggest supporter.\nIf it were not for the Empress favoring the original host, the latter would’ve already died many times over by the means of the Eldest Imperial Princess. The original host’s wish was, in fact, related to her eldest sister.\nWith a wanton and unrestrained character, the original host loved all kinds of handsome men, and never bothered fighting for the throne. She merely wanted to be an idle princess after her eldest sister succeeded the throne. The Eldest Imperial Princess, however, didn’t let her off.\nThis good eldest sister of hers knew that she loved beautiful men, so she specially sent a gorgeous young man over to seduce her. The Third Imperial Princess was captivated by the young lad’s temperament and beauty, and fell head over heels for him. In the end, she was coaxed into downing a cup of poisoned wine, only to learn the truth right before her death.\nThe good-looking young man was her eldest sister’s lover and didn’t like her. He was merely playing along with her and feigned civility. And, the sister she’d deeply respected all those years actually wanted her dead.

The original host was truly a great beauty with astounding features.\nThough she didn’t want a man to help her get dressed, getting dressed in these ancient attires was actually a laborious and arduous task. Thus, many women in this world didn’t even bother doing it themselves. Therefore, even if Yu Chu wanted to find some personal maids to wait upon her, she wouldn’t find one. \nShe had no choice but to recall the attendant. The young man was slender with delicate features. He respectfully attended to her and helped her comb her hair with practiced movements.

She was indeed good-looking.\nThe aesthetics of this female-dominated society was still normal, it wasn’t that women had to be masculine while men had to be feminine.\nThe formation of this world’s system wasn’t determined by physical strength. It was similar to a matriarchal clan, where reproduction and economic duties were the most important things. Thus, women who could give birth naturally had a higher status than men. They were placed in charge of the state and held power in their hands.\nAs for the men, although they were fitter than women, the system dictated them to please women. To please them physically and psychologically. They had to have slender and fit appearances that could satisfy the womenfolk, and had to possess the ability to flirt and speak words of love… Only then were they considered good husband material.\nChapter 182: The Monarch’s No. 1 Beauty (3)\nAppearance and aesthetic-wise, some women also liked feminine and tender men but in general, the majority of the women preferred slender and stylish masculine men. After all, they could also wait upon them better and satisfy them more in terms of bedroom affairs.\nAs for the men’s standards towards a woman’s appearance, it was very simple. As long as a woman had stunning features and exquisite curves, it was fine. It would be even better if that person was chic, possessed literary talent, and so on… Countless men would be satisfied with this kind of woman as their wife.\nAs for the Third Imperial Princess… She always had a look of infatuation when she saw beautiful men, spoiling her original beauty. This time, however, she was totally expressionless, which accentuated her gorgeous features. The outer corners of her eyes were slightly arched, and her looks were so captivating that one didn’t dare to look straight at her.\nThe young man was slightly stunned. He’d subconsciously blurted out those words of praise. If he said that in front of other noblewomen, this was considered acting out of line.

I’ll buy it for you,” Brother Assist walked toward the touchscreen interface of the Auction House.\n“Okay. Get me an appropriate level 30 mage robe, as well as a necklace, ring, and emblem that increase the proc rate of a weapon’s fire attack,” Gu Fei said.\nBrother Assist distanced himself from the interface while saying, “It’s about time. You should get out of here!”\nGu Fei did not even have time to reply.\nThe two rushed out of the city as they left the Auction House. After walking for a short distance, they heard a flurry of footsteps. Gu Fei looked back and saw a bunch of players heading straight toward the Auction House.\n“They can’t all be after me!” Gu Fei expressed his shock.\n“It appears they are,” Brother Assist affirmed.\n“There’re so many of them!” Gu Fei exclaimed.\n“Just turn yourself in,” Brother Assist calmly replied.\n“Nah...” Gu Fei declined.\n“Perhaps you should cover your face. With many people looking for you, there’s no guarantee that a sharp-eyed player won’t discover you. Those who have accepted this mission will see a conspicuous serial number marking on you,” Brother Assist advised.\n“Alright. But I’ll leave the city first. There’re too many pairs of eyes around, which make things difficult,” Gu Fei hastily bolted out of the city. Brother Assist’s speed was not a match for Gu Fei’s, so he could only shout after his fleeing figure, “Be careful!”\nGu Fei waved his hand in acknowledgement without even turning around.\nBrother Assist returned to the Auction House alone. Countless players were searching the place thoroughly, with more joining in as time went by. Brother Assist thought he had a good grasp of the situation’s severity, yet he had not expected Gu Fei to attract these many pursuers. Human’s curiosity was indeed a frightening thing.\nBrother Assist contacted Young Master Han and his fellow mercenary mates once he had left the Auction House. All were extremely astonished when they heard the news, “WHAT? That guy didn’t know about the PvP rules?”\n“That guy is hopeless! Meeting! We’re having an emergency meeting!” Young Master Han first criticized Gu Fei before telling everyone to meet at the usual hangout, Ray’s Bar.\nMeanwhile, Gale Force of Traversing Four Seas hurriedly sought their guild leader, Oathless Sword.\n“Our chance is here!” The main door to Traversing Four Seas’ guild house almost flew off its hinges when Gale Force came crashing through."}

Who else could it be besides that Masked Slayer?”\n“Let’s go take a look!” Oathless Sword and Gale Force hurriedly strode off toward the Bounty Assignment Hall.\nA large crowd had gathered in front of the Bounty Assignment Hall’s Wanted Players list interface. Oathless Sword’s eyes swept through the crowd and noticed that many core members of the various guilds in Yunduan City were here as well. Oathless Sword easily guessed their intentions; they hoped to befriend this powerful expert and pull the Masked Slayer into their guilds. Although Oathless Sword had such thoughts as well, he figured that mulling over it was pointless since nobody could tell who would receive such privilege with these many competitors.\nOathless Sword turned to check the Wanted Players list. The Masked Slayer was listed high on the board – PK points: 15, serial number 27149.\nMany of the people inside the hall did not immediately receive the mission as they were confident that Gu Fei would turn himself in. They closely observed all the players coming and going since this hall was also a place where fugitives could turn themselves in. Their eyes would periodically gleam whenever they saw a Mage and then be followed by a look of disappointment.\n“This explains why he did not turn himself in. Doing so is as good as walking straight into the lion’s den,” Oathless Sword mumbled to himself. Quite a few Mages were entering and exiting the place, yet the serial number 27149 remained on the top spot.\nIn one corner of the hall, July, Luo Luo, and Lie Lie were observing the human traffic as well.\n“Ah, that one! That’s definitely him! He’s wearing a beginner robe!” Lie Lie boomed as she pointed to a player for the seventeenth time.\nLuo Luo appraised the player and sighed, “Lie Lie! A pro may not necessarily be handsome, so curb your wishful thinking and stop calling my attention to every good-looking Mage here! That last one is only at level 12.”\n“Oh....”\n“How long have we been here, anyway?” July asked.\n“Close to half an hour,” Luo Luo answered."}

Buy the land and then purchase the other things according to the number of fields.\n“I agree! When we satisfied with the land, we will visit the livestock market and learn more about the prices. We need to buy them at the right price and livestock is cheaper in the winter than at the beginning of spring! For now, let’s work hard on our own, then we can take care of winter! Lian Fang Zhou laughed.\nLian Ze laughed with her, feeling very happy. “Sister, do we have to buy donkeys and donkey carts? I can’t even image it! Don’t worry, I will take good care of them in the future!”\n“Oh, won’t this delay your practice?” Lian Fang Zhou raised her eyebrows and joked, causing the three of them to laugh.\nLian Ze got up before dawn today to practice cultivation, saying that it would be the same in the future. He really was studying hard to learn martial arts and protect his family.\n“Sister!” Lian Ze scratched his head, looking very embarrassed, and said solemnly: “Never! I have the help the family with work too, everyone is still so young, I can’t tire my sister!”\n“Sister really has a good brother!” Lian Fang Zhou smiled.\nThe three of them entered the city and first went to the bank to exchange one thousands tael bank notes into seven ‘hundred taels’. The remaining three ‘hundred taels’ were split into ‘fifty taels’ and ‘twelve taels’. She also kept twelve ounces of broken silver in her pocket for petty use.\nBecause Dafang Village was not too far away from the county seat, villagers needed to go directly to the city if they wanted to buy land. Villages that were more remote would usually go to the nearest town for such things.\nThe three of them inquired about where to find the home of Liu Jia, the land steward who bought and sold land around the county seat, and bought two boxes of dim sum from a dim sum shop.\nLiu Jia happened to be at home and when the three strangers appeared, he knew that it must be a business matter. He smiled politely and greeted: “How many surnames? Are you here to buy land? Haha, come and sit!”\nWhen Liu Jia spoke, he directed his words to Ah Jian as he was the only adult among the three of them. He took it for granted that Ah Jian was in charge.\nAh Jian nodded and said, “We want to look at the mountains. I wonder if there is anything suitable?”\nLian Fang Zhou added: “We are from Dafang Village. If you can, see if you can sell something close to Dafang or in a nearby village!”"}

Nicole and Gwen also had a bit of a problem with each other, despite their fierce battle on the beach. So Adrian rarely brought all the women together at the same time.\nIt was okay before, but since Sandy and Alice were born, Adrian was always busy at the mothers’ gatherings – busy mediating their relationships to prevent any trouble. He", "reference": "“Okay, let’s go, otherwise the following two little guys will run up.” Adrian said after a while, so he walked up the stairs with arms around Sophie and Monica.\nBut in two steps, he reached out and squeezed their still buttocks hard, and the previous atmosphere suddenly disappeared. Although Sophie and Monica were annoyed, they could only give him a glance. Adrian couldn’t help laughing.\nGoing downstairs, grabbing Dava and Juliet running around, a group of people went out and got on the car to the Beverly Hills, Adrian mansion. Today is the monthly gathering of mothers.\nFrankly speaking, as the number of children increases, this party gradually becomes a little tasteless. Adrian initially arranged this to take into account that the children’s mothers should be relatively peaceful when they get together. Can communicate better with each other. However, as the number of children increases, the mother team also increases. Zeta Jones, Nicole and Naomi were added last year and this year. Adrian has already hinted at Rachel and she chose the default. In the future, Alexander, Miranda, Britney, Christina and so on, I am afraid that none of them can run away, one can imagine.\nThen, people will always hold a group, and those who do not deal with them will never deal with them. For example, Zeta Jones has always been unable to talk to Cate. In fact, the three Cate do not deal with it very much, but Blanchett is more restrained. And Nicole and Gwyneth always have a little friction with each other, although they have fought fiercely at the beach party, so Adrian rarely pulls all women down on the same occasion.\nIt was okay before, but after Sandy and Alice were born, every time their mothers gathered, Adrian would be very busy and balance their relationship, so as to avoid any trouble. Of course, he can also cancel the big party and divide it into several small parties to let the mothers who have a good relationship with each other chat and communicate together, but he hardly ever thought about it.\n“I don’t want Lily to feel alienated from her sisters in the future,” Adrian said seriously after Cate asked this question implicitly, “We are already a big family anyway, I hope the children Being able to get along peacefully, even because of the increase of age, there must be a lot of friction between each other, and may even be against the eyes, but at least it will not be naturally contradictory because of the different mothers.”"}
{"source": "“……还不是你的错。”凯特沉默许久后这么说了句，语带讽刺但同时也很无可奈何，谁让这个混蛋将自己“绑架”了呢。\n当然，阿德里安也不否认这是自己的错，所以每个月这么痛并快乐一次也没什么大不了，反正他现在时间也有很多。\n多余的时间除了让他可以更好安排这些外，还可以用来更详细的谋划一些电影，比如凯特的下一部冲奥斯卡而去的作品。目前她的几次提名，阿德里安都只是在后面推了一把，已经积累了不少资历，演技也一步步的磨练了出来，所以他这次特意选了部凯特“曾经”的政治电影，打算看看自己不插手的话，她能做到什么地步。\n除此之外，就是新线正在忙活的《暮光之城》了，已经确认将出演女主角的杰西卡?斯托亚迪诺维奇，目前因为他的恶趣味已经正式改名为史托雅?多尔。当然，他也已经在床上尝过了，改名的史托雅相当听话，她知道是谁给自己这些，所以阿德里安无论有什么要求她都会去做。\n对于她这副听话而柔顺的模样，阿德里安很满意，再看看有自己干预而挑选出来的《暮光之城》的演员名单。除了出演女主角两位同学的克里斯汀和金泰熙外，阿什丽?格林尼和布鲁克林?戴可儿分别饰演卡伦家的一对姐妹，饰演女主角母亲的是阿曼达?皮特，而饰演卡伦太太的则是詹纽瑞?琼斯。\n都还不错，有史托雅帮忙的话，就像艾梅柏那样，一个一个搞定她们应该不是难事。哦，说到这里，以艾梅柏那颇显妖艳的模样，阿德里安打算让在她在第二部里饰演那个反派女性吸血鬼之一，而另一个……依然还是达科塔?范宁。\n按阿德里安的想法，达科塔目前在童星方面已经没有再上升的空间，而很快每个童星所需要面对的尴尬期就会来临。所以缓上一点，饰演些这种商业角色，将这段时期度过了最好，不过她似乎也有一些属于自己的想法。\n“这个是……”阿德里安看了看手中的剧本，然后看向坐在自己面前略有些紧张的达科塔。\n“我只是想要听听您的意见。”她用一副恭敬的口吻说道。", "hypothesis": "\n   “……It's not your fault,” Kate said after a long silence, her tone laced with sarcasm but also a hint of resignation. Who was she to blame this idiot for kidnapping her, after all?\nOf course, Adrian didn't deny that it was his fault, so he didn't mind going through this cycle every month. He had plenty of time on his hands, and he could use it to plan his next move, like Kate's next Oscar-bait film. He had been uietly backing her up for her previous nominations, and he had accumulated a lot of experience and honed his acting skills. This time, he deliberately chose a film that Kate had done before, a political drama, to see how far she could go without his interference.\nAside from that, there was New Line's Twilight, which had confirmed Jessica Stoyadinovitch as the female lead. She had already been renamed to Stoyadina, and Adrian had already tested her out in bed. She was very obedient, and she knew who had given her the new name, so Adrian was satisfied with her behavior. He looked over the cast list for Twilight, which he had carefully selected. Apart from Kristen and Kaitlyn, who were his classmates, the rest of the cast was decent. Ashley Greene and Brooklyn Decker would play the Cullen sisters, Amanda Seyfried would play the mother, and Jane Seymour would play the Cullen matriarch.\nIt was all good, and with Stoyadina's help, he could easily manipulate the rest of the cast. Speaking of which, he thought of Amber, who was uite the seductress. He planned to cast her as one of the female vampires in the second", "reference": "“…It’s not your fault.” Cate said this after a long silence, ironically but at the same time helpless, who let the **** “kidnap” himself.\nOf course, Adrian does not deny that it is his own fault, so it’s no big deal to be so painful and happy once a month, anyway, he has a lot of time now.\nIn addition to allowing him to arrange these better, the extra time can also be used to plan some movies in more detail, such as Cate’s next work to go to Oscar. At present, in her several nominations, Adrian has just pushed one behind, and has accumulated a lot of qualifications, and her acting skills have been hone step by step. So this time he specially selected a Cate “Once” political movie. I plan to see what she can do without intervening.\nIn addition, the new line is busy with “Twilight”, has confirmed that she will star in the heroine Jessica? Stoja Dinovic, currently because of his bad taste has been officially renamed For Stoya? Dole. Of course, he has already tasted it in bed, and the renamed Stoya is quite obedient. She knows who gave it to herself, so she will do whatever the Adrian asks.\nAdrian is very satisfied with her obedient and supple appearance, and then look at the list of actors in “Twilight” that was selected by her own intervention~IndoMTL.com~ In addition to the stars who played two heroines Outside of Justin and Kim Tae-hee, Ashley Greene and Brooklyn Decker respectively played a pair of sisters of the Karen family, the heroine’s mother was Amanda Pete, and Mrs. Karen’s Janny Ray Jones.\nIt’s not bad. If Stoyar helps, like Aimeibo, it shouldn’t be difficult to get them one by one. Oh, speaking of this, Adrian intends to play one of the villainous female vampires in her second part, and the other…still Dakota Fanning.\nAccording to Adrian‘s ideas, Dakota has no room to rise in child stars, and soon the embarrassment period that each child star needs to face will come. So take it easy and play some of these business roles to spend the best of this period, but she seems to have some ideas of her own.\n“This is…” Adrian looked at the script in his hand and then looked at Dakota who was slightly nervous in front of him.\n“I just want to hear your opinion.” She said in a respectful tone."}

Also because Wanxiang Sect is too rich, it's easy to recruit people.\n\"Boom, boom...\" The sound of footsteps sounded.\nA seemingly young swordsman walked in with two guards. The swordsman swept his eyes and locked the cultured middle-aged man sitting at the desk.\nObserving the steps, eyes, and temperament of the people coming, this landlord who knows many people instantly has his own judgment: \"This is a decisive master, with a strong aura. This sword technique is estimated to be equally strong, and it should be a very strong man.

For example, public universities, public hospitals, and research institutions, which recruit high-level talents, academic talents, or discipline leaders, will not only help them solve the problem of employment, but also provide housing, help their spouses find jobs, and help their children transfer schools, etc. Sports coaches are also a special talent, and the provincial sports team will have a non-examination employment every year to introduce excellent talents. Moreover, the provincial sports team belongs to the provincial sports bureau, and the coaches of the provincial sports team are also employed by the provincial sports bureau, which is higher than the county and city level. Xu Zhongyi said that he had the ability to operate the employment of the provincial sports team, which was not without foundation. Many people may think that being a sports coach has no power and no influence, and is a very unpromising job, but in fact, it is not so, especially when you reach the level of head coach, you can make decisions on your own, and the power in your hands is much more than what you see on the surface. This can be seen from the coaches of the national team who live in luxury and drive luxury cars. Xu Zhongyi is the head coach of the provincial swimming team and has also cultivated athletes like Yu Feifei,", "reference": "Chapter 51: An Iron Bowl\nTo apply for \"civil servant\" positions in public institutions, individuals had to take recruitment tests. There were some companies and positions that didn't require test scores for people with special skills, however. When public universities, public hospitals, or scientific research institutions were seeking high-level workers, academic-based manpower, or academic leaders, they would help organize personnel, while also offering housing, arrange job for the workers' spouses, transferring children to another school, etc.\nCoaching also required special talent. Every year the provincial sport team would offer test-free recruitment to new talent. Moreover, the sports team belonged to the Provincial Sport Bureau, which was a provincial institution. Working as a coach for the team was obviously superior to county-level sport teams.\nWhen Coach Xu had said that he was capable of interfering with the sports team's recruitment procedures, he was not bragging. Maybe to some people being a sports coach held no value in the real world. In actuality, however, it was the opposite. Especially when one became a chief coach, he or she could take charge of a lot of things alone, and have much more power than the average person thought. Think about coaches from national teams—they lived in big houses, drove expensive cars, and enjoyed a lot of benefits.\nCoach Xu was the chief coach of the provincial swimming team, and he had even helped Feifei Yu grow into the world champion. Around the nation there were only a few world champions, and on average there was only one world record holder across several provinces, which was quite low. Therefore, Coach Xu was at the top among all the coaches in the Hanbei Province, making him very respectable and powerful.\nCoach Xu may not have been powerful enough to directly get a formally organized personnel, but he could recommend talent to superiors. If it was some other coach's recommendation, it might have been disregarded, but Coach Xu's words were quite powerful. He had coached the world's top swimmers, which had proved his knack for spotting talent. His recommendation was weighed heavily.\nSocial status mattered. Take online novels, for example: if a newbie's work could receive a famous author's recommendation, then both readers and other authors would think highly of them; if the referrer was not known by many people, then his recommendation would probably be useless.\nCoach Xu knew that if Dai Li hadn't offered his help, Feifei Yu would probably have been destroyed. To pay Li back, he tried his best to work things out. He used his reputation to his advantage. Soon after that, Coach Xu heard great news—his recommendation was valued highly by a sub-administration vice-director of the Sport Bureau.\nThe next day, Coach Xu want to meet this vice-director."}

You know if Chen likes him then he must be a good one.\"\nThe vice-director nodded in affirmation. He also knew Coach Chen pretty well. If Chen had taken note of Li's ability and had brought him here to Qingcheng City, coupled with Xu's recommendation, then it proved that Li was a competent person.\nThe vice-director remained silent for several seconds, then asked Xu, \" I saw on Li's resume that his special talent is to help \"maintain weight,\" what does that mean?\"\n\"It's 'helping athletes maintain weight.'\" Coach Xu hesitated for a few seconds, then leaned towards the vice-director and said, \"Director, there is something that I must report.

You were the one who held the news publication,\" said the vice-director.\nCoach Xu lowered his voice. \"Actually, not all of the gossip was wrong. Part of it was true.\"\n\"What do you mean?\" the vice-president frowned.\n\"The part about her weight was true. Feifei Yu did weigh 70 kg at that time, and nobody could help. But it was this Dai Li who helped her lose 15kg! That was why we dared to let Feifei do the weighing on the spot. Li is very good at maintaining athletes' weight.\" Xu leaned forward again, saying, \"Until I spoke to the national team's chief coach, Donglai Huo, I did not know that the swimming training center was having a meeting at the same time as I was.

That is to say, this group of arrowfish has a certain range of perception, only when entering their perception range, will trigger the so-called challenge.\nThen, the group of arrowfish did not rush up at once.

There were even ones that had grown faces.\nWei Xiao Bei felt that leg hair almost became his greatest nightmare.\nLuckily, he had been training his spear techniques these few days with his master.\nCheng Bi Wu was already 45 years old. He had been training for 38 years and was now at the peak of his life. His martial arts skills were also approaching the peak.\nWei Xiao Bei remembered one time when Cheng Bi Wu got drunk. He had proudly said that when he was 26 years old, he had understood negative jing.\nEveryone who knew Guo Shu were aware that a person’s energy was divided into parts. They were roughly known as positive jing, negative jing, and neutral jing. In rough terms, this was how a person used their body’s energy.\nIn more accurate words, this was a category of Qi usage.\nPositive jing was a person’s strength, which was expressed through their fists and kicks. This was the foundation of a martial artist: using their own energy to attack, and making the amount of force they used to be the same as the force applied.\nAs a result, positive jing was also called the energy at the tip of the branch, which means the energy that was released.\nHowever, a normal person could use 30 percent of their body’s potential. If they punched with their fists, they could exert 40 percent of their arm strength, while kicking would exert 50 percent of their leg strength.\nOn the other hand, those who have trained their bodies before like soldiers and amateur boxers could use at most 50 percent of their bodies’ potential. They were individuals who were able to exert energy on multiple parts of their bodies at the same time, such as using both forces of the waist and legs simultaneously.\nAnother step further would be those who could use 80 percent of their bodies. They were people who could combine three different energies on various parts of their bodies at the same time, such as combining the forces of the waist, legs, and fists simultaneously. With such a combination, their fists would be able to make whistling sounds in the air.\nThe highest realm of positive jing would be a person who could use their body’s full potential. They would not only combine the forces of their legs, waist, and fists but also use special techniques such as Iron Mountain Lean, which utilized the neck and the lower legs.\nAfter positive jing was negative jing. In terms of Guo Shu, negative jing was also called lowered elbow fighting. What did this mean?\nIn general, it meant that a person must hide the positive jing in the middle section of their body such as the arms and thighs. In this way, a person would be able to attack and defend during fights. It was different from positive jing which only focused on attacking and not defending.\nAs a result, negative jing was also called the energy at the middle section of the branch. However, negative jing did not increase a person’s strength. A person’s strength still relied on their positive jing."}

At this level, even if someone punches you, you can easily counter the force of the other person. As the saying goes, \"the great way is the same, and the transformation of energy is the same.\" In fact, when the energy is transformed, whether it is Tai Chi or Baguazhang, there is a sense of speed and transformation.

In order to master neutral jing, a person must store energy all over the body. It could also be counted as an advanced version of negative jing.\nA person who trained in neutral jing could store energy anywhere in their body and could release the energy at anytime.\nBy being able to store and release energy at one’s will, birds should not even think of leaving if they landed on the individual’s  body. The energy released by the person’s body would be able to counteract the force of a bird’s upward movement.\nWhen a person reached this level, even if the opponent hit them, they would be able to easily release energy to counter the incoming punch.\nThis entirety was called the great way of martial arts. In truth, when a person reached the level of neutral jing, they would be able to feel the similarities in different martial arts such as Taiji and Bajiquan.\nAn example of a martial art that utilizes neutral jing is Zhang Yi 18 drops.\nAs a result, this kind of martial arts was only a type of martial arts and could not be considered a realm of martial arts.\nFrom this, it was easy to tell how bad it was to fight against a master of negative jing.\nWei Xiao Bei was not able to see the realm his own master was in, but by training with him, he was able to feel a certain level of oppression that prevented him from exerting energy outward.\nEverytime Wei Xiao Bei thrusted his spear, Cheng Bi Wu was able to easily ward off the attack and made a counterattack, forcing Wei Xiao Bei into a tragic state.

It's as if the artist is trying to convey a sense of mystery and grandeur, but it's hard to put your finger on what's not uite right. The more you look at it, the more you feel a shiver run down your spine. \"Is that dog really that scary?\" one of the students asked, recalling a time when he saw a small, fluffy dog in the schoolyard. He searched online to confirm that he wasn't mistaken.

It’s very simple,” a sorcerer could not help but chime in, smiling.\n“Thank you.” \nLin Sheng nodded at him.\nHe needed to find the other fragments quickly. He had thought of conquering more dark spirits to get more pure soul power. \nBut since he got this opportunity, he was more than happy to take my offer.\nThe head of the sorcerers brought Lin Sheng at one Darkspirit Gate. \nThey both reached out their hands, touching the frame of the gate with eyes closed. \nWith his special ability, the head of the sorcerer started to build a dimensional base for coordinate confirmation. \nFollowing that, the ritual perturbation of the Darkspirit Gate was transmitted together with Lin Sheng’s conscious perception.\n“An ordinary teleportation ritual is point-to-point transmission. ”\n“But when we explore other dimensional realms, we change it to become one-to-multiple-point transmission. ” \n“What we need to do is to make some minor changes to the parameters on the transmission base.” \nThe head of the sorcerers was guiding Lin Sheng’s consciousness as he taught him the technique. \n“This way, the Darkspirit Gate will spontaneously transmit our consciousness into multiple target-dimensions. ”\n“It is the luck of the draw. If we get lucky, we might bump into the dimensional realm we are looking for. If we get no luck, just try a few more times.”\n“That’s random enough, though.” \nLin Sheng was dumbfounded.\nThe ritual instantly perturbed his perception the minute he stepped into the Darkspirit Gate, wrapping it inside as it spread out.\nAt the same time, his consciousness seemed to break apart, his perception split into a dozen tiny pieces, feeling the energy in a dozen different dimensions.\n“Generally, we can’t keep our consciousness in one piece during the transmission. We can only try to remember as best as we can the dimensional coordinates we came across.” \n“We need to leave a simple mark on the coordinates…”\nOutside, the sorcerer chief kept doing the explaining, guiding Lin Sheng how to create the simple marking in determining the coordinate code. \nBut one thing he had not expected; Lin Sheng’s consciousness was so strong that he could memorize all the coordinates of the dimensions that his consciousness pieces came into. \nTo Lin Sheng, it was just a matter of multitasking, a skill that he had been training for every day.\nHe could use his split consciousness to direct and observe his every summoned creature, although he could not independently control them at the same time. \nMemorizing the perturbation and determining the coordinates were just a walk in the park. \nHis strong soul played a part and he could stay for a longer time."}

Seeing the two men sitting motionless on the ground, White Yan's face darkened slightly: \"What?\" \"You're still waiting for me to help you up?\" The woman's sharp voice fell into Fire Feather's ears, shocking him into scrambling to his feet. His pant legs were covered in blood, and he couldn't even stand steadily. Yet he still stood there, his legs shaking uncontrollably, and didn't dare to kneel down again. White Yan looked at the two men, who were struggling to stay upright, and pointed to the stone seat on the ground: \"Sit down, rest for a bit, and you'll be able to leave the mountain soon.\"     She was deceived that day, so how could she not be deceived by the Elder and Fire Feather?

Seeing the two men sitting motionless on the ground, White Yan's face", "reference": "What’s more, does she even have the right to get angry at these two when she herself was fooled into those lies? Of course not!\nFire Plume on the other hand was stiff as a rock right now despite the goodwill. This loyal subordinate of Di Cang’s just couldn’t believe he’s going to be let off the hook this easily. \nIn fact, this bird man has prepared for the worse. \nThe bare minimum would be a long session of being whipped until their skin was bleeding, or at least lose half their life in the process.\nGetting annoyed in the face after getting no reaction from the two: “What?” \n“Do you want me to help lift you two up or something?”\nSure enough, the fierce voice finally knocked them both out of the dazed state. Jerking up in his haste, Fire Plume suddenly found himself unable to steady his legs due to the scrapes he suffered so far. \nEven so, he continues to force that shaky leg to remain standing in light of how awkward and funny he appears. If one had to describe his appearance, it would be like a duck squatting around after being tired out.\nUnable to bear this ridiculous picture, Bai Yan rolls her eyes and points to the stone stools nearby: “Sit over there and rest. Once the both of you are better then go back.”"}
