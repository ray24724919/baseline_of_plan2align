She had already been renamed to Stoyadina, and Adrian had already tested her out in bed. She was very obedient, and she knew who had given her the new name, so Adrian was satisfied with her behavior. He looked over the cast list for Twilight, which he had carefully selected. Apart from Kristen and Kaitlyn, who were his classmates, the rest of the cast was decent.
