Did you get any information?\" The pear's heart was filled with anxiety, and the dream of awakening was ultimately fleeting and superficial, only able to obtain partial information about the ability.\n\nHowever, the information obtained is related to the difficulty of restoring the entire ability blueprint.\n\nStone Xiaobai replied, \"I probably know what my ability is.\"\n\n\"Really?\" The pear was overjoyed and asked, \"Tell me, where did you get the information?\"\n\nStone Xiaobai said, \"Power, I can get some power from other people.\"\n\nThe pear was taken aback and asked, \"Huh? What else?\"\n\nStone Xiaobai tilted his head and thought for a moment, then shrugged and said, \"That's it.\"\n\nThe pear's eyes widened in surprise, what does that mean?\n\nThe pear sighed and let out a deep breath, although she didn't expect the dream of awakening to obtain much information, but only getting a vague information, she didn't expect it.\n\nBeing able to get power from other people can be considered as an effect, but what are the conditions for obtaining power? Are there any restrictions on getting power from other people?\n\nIn order to use one's ability smoothly, one must be extremely clear about the three major rules of effect, condition, and restriction, and the complete ability blueprint is extremely important.\n\nStone Xiaobai's information is only a small part of the iceberg, and even not even a small part of the iceberg.\n\nBut the pear knows that now is not the time to complain about these things, everything is her fault, and she must help Stone Xiaobai restore the complete ability blueprint, otherwise she will be anxious in her heart.\n\n\"Do you know how to get power from other people? For example, by completing a specific action or doing something?\" The pear asked tentatively.\n\nStone Xiaobai was taken aback, thought for a moment, and nodded and said, \"I seem to know how to do it.\"\n\nHow to get power from other people, he indeed has some vague concepts in his mind.\n\n\"Really?\" The pear was overjoyed, as long as he knows how to use the ability, he can continue to experiment and explore the ability blueprint, she hurriedly said, \"Then try it quickly! Ah, you can use me as the target, get power from me!\"\n\nBeing an ability experiment target is actually a very dangerous thing, who knows what kind of power it is, will the power be damaged after being taken away, and will the power be restored or not.\n\nBut the pear has already thought about it, in her opinion, everything is her fault, she is the most responsible person to become Stone Xiaobai's experiment object, she must take responsibility, even if it means paying a price.", "elapsed": 13135.402251243591, "call": 610}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

Stone White usually wouldn't ask such questions, he would just go straight to it, but he was asking now, which proved that this ability would cause great harm to the target.\n\nLily's gaze struggled for a moment, but she quickly calmed down. She took a deep breath and said seriously, \"I'm sure, let's go!\"\n\nLily puffed out her chest, indicating that she was willing to take the risk.\n\n\"Okay, then the king won't be polite,\" Stone White didn't hesitate any further and went straight to it, which was his style. Stone White slowly extended his right hand towards Lily.\n\nLily looked at the hand that was getting closer and closer, although she said she was willing to take the risk, her heart was still uneasy. Humans always fear the unknown.\n\nLily closed her eyes with some fear, encouraged herself in her heart, come on, even if the power is taken away and causes severe pain, it's something she should bear the responsibility for! Lily tightly closed her eyes, held her breath, and waited anxiously for Stone White to use his ability on her.\n\nSuddenly, Lily was shocked to feel that her high and proud ***** was being held by someone! That team of holy softness was gently held, five fingers sank into it, and a tingling sensation immediately spread throughout her body!\n\n\"Ah!\" Her ***** was touched, Lily instinctively cried out in shock, quickly jumped back, and covered her chest with her hands, staring at Stone White's hand that was still holding her ***** in a state of disbelief.\n\n\"Why?\" Lily looked at Stone White's face, which was blinking with a pure and innocent expression, unable to believe that he would desecrate her untouched ***** in such a shameless way!\n\nLily's face turned bright red, and her eyes were slightly red. \"I thought you were a good person, but I never thought you would be like this, Stone White!\"\n\nLily was filled with shame and anger, even if she had made a mistake, it was unintentional, and she had already tried to make up for it. Why did he have to treat her like this, using such a humiliating way to punish her?\n\n\"Power!\" Stone White suddenly pointed to Lily's chest, which was covered by her hands, and said calmly, \"You're not letting me get the power from you, are you? The power is there!\"\n\nLily heard this and her eyes were wide with shock, Stone White's ability target was a woman's *****?\n\nA few minutes later, after Stone White's vague explanation, Lily's face was still red, but she finally calmed down.", "elapsed": 12067.339990377426, "call": 579}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

A faint fragrance wafted from the incense burner, and the delicate smoke danced in the air. On the intricately carved, half-canopied bed, the exquisite floral patterns were intricately carved, and a light veil covered it. A silhouette of a woman with a slender figure was faintly visible.\n\nAfter understanding the situation, Yu Chu's heart was filled with mixed emotions. She was happy that this was a world where women dominated and men were subordinate, and as a woman, she had many advantages. However, she was worried about... the host's reputation in this world, which was indeed not very good.\n\nShe got up from the bed, and her shadow fell on the screen in the adjacent room. The room outside was filled with gold and precious stones.\n\nThe servant who had been waiting outside immediately bowed and stepped inside, his voice trembling with a hint of youthfulness: \"Your Highness, are you getting up?\"\n\nYu Chu looked up and took a glance at the young man. He was quite handsome, with a clear and bright complexion, and his lowered eyebrows were very gentle. On one hand, he was afraid of her, and on the other hand, he was trying to please her. This was indeed the female dominant world.\n\nYu Chu took a deep breath and thought about the original owner's personality and temperament. She leaned against the bed lazily and waved her hand at the servant: \"You can go.\"\n\nThe young man was taken aback. It was natural for a noblewoman to have servants attend to her when she got up. Especially someone like the Third Princess, who was known for her promiscuous and flirtatious nature. It was common for her to have servants attend to her and even tease them when she got up. The sudden dismissal left the young man stunned, and he looked up at the bed, where the princess was lying.\n\nThe Third Princess was half-reclining on the bed, her eyes slightly narrowed, and her beautiful face was still drowsy. She looked lazy and carefree, and for some reason, she suddenly made the young man's heart skip a beat. The young man quickly lowered his head, his face flushing with embarrassment.\n\nAlthough he had served the Third Princess before, he had never thought that she was so beautiful. The princess had a stunning face, and in the entire Kyoto, there was no one as beautiful as her. However, she was also known for her promiscuous and flirtatious nature, and she was often considered a troublemaker.\n\nOnce someone became notorious for their promiscuity, even if they were beautiful, people would not have romantic thoughts about them. That's why the men in Kyoto avoided her, and no one wanted to get involved with her.\n\nThe young man was initially nervous and helpless, thinking that he would have to endure the princess's teasing again. However, he didn't think about escaping, as he was just a servant, and unlike the noble sons, he didn't have better options.

He should be grateful from the heart.\n\nThe young man whispered softly and then left. However, he stopped in the outer room and, for some reason, glanced at the screen again.\n\nBehind the screen, a beautiful woman's figure was reflected, and her carefree and lazy dressing movements made people feel a little... blush and palpitate.\n\nThe young man suddenly thought that the princess was not bad, although she was very ugly and a fool, she was indeed beautiful and had a high status.\n\nFrom now on, he should still try to please her. He made a silent decision, and his face turned red again, he lowered his head and stood respectfully with his head bowed.\n\nChapter 181: The First Flower of the Female Dominant (2)\n\nYu Chu was unaware of the little servant's thoughts in the outer room, but she was flipping through the memories of the original owner, laughing and crying in dismay, thinking that the original owner was promiscuous, but it was good... it was still the first time.\n\nShe sorted out the original owner's memories. In this world where women dominated and men were inferior, the original owner's identity was also very prestigious, being the third princess of the imperial family. Although the original owner's character was a bit flawed, lacking in some aspects, and being too hasty, she was still a good person... well.\n\nThe second princess had died early, and the empress had only two daughters, the eldest princess and the third princess. The eldest princess was raised with strict discipline, while the youngest daughter was spoiled rotten. This was also the third princess's biggest backing. If the empress hadn't favored the original owner, the third princess would have been killed by the eldest princess many times over.\n\nThe original owner's wish was also related to the eldest princess.\n\nThe original owner was a free-spirited person who loved beautiful men and had never thought of competing for the throne, but wanted to wait for her sister to inherit the throne and become a carefree prince. However, the eldest princess did not let her off.\n\nThis good sister knew that her sister loved handsome men, so she specially sent a beautiful young man to seduce her. The third princess was mesmerized by the young man's charm and beauty, and was eventually tricked into drinking a poisonous wine, only to discover the truth.\n\nThe young man was actually the eldest princess's man, and he didn't like the third princess, but was just pretending to be friendly. The third princess respected her sister, but her sister was actually trying to kill her. So she was not willing to give up.\n\nHer wish was to avenge her sister and the young man who had deceived her emotions. She wanted to make sure that her sister, who had killed her for the throne, would never get the throne in this life, and that the young man who had tricked her into drinking the poisonous wine would never get love in this life.\n\nYu Chu thought, how can she make sure that person won't get love?

The two of them must have been in love for a long time.\n\nI'm so frustrated. Chu Yu rubbed her temples, thinking that the only way to resolve this situation was to separate the First Princess from the young man.\n\nWhy not just make it so they can never see each other again? That way, neither of them would get their love.\n\nShe got dressed and looked at her reflection in the mirror. The original owner was indeed a beauty.\n\nAlthough she didn't like men waiting on her to get ready, the women of this world didn't have the luxury of doing such delicate tasks themselves. So, even if Chu Yu wanted to hire a few personal maids to help her get ready, it wouldn't be possible.\n\nShe had to call one of the servants in from outside. The young man was tall and slender, with a clear and handsome face. He served her with great respect, his movements practiced and efficient. Before long, he had styled her hair into a beautiful updo, and then hesitated for a moment before speaking in a soft voice, \"Your Highness is truly beautiful...\"\n\nHis eyes, filled with a hint of shyness, looked up at Chu Yu's reflection in the mirror. She was indeed beautiful.\n\nThe aesthetic standards of a matriarchal society were normal, not like the idea that women had to be masculine and men had to be effeminate. The formation of the matriarchal system wasn't determined by physical strength, but rather by the importance of reproduction and economic responsibilities. As a result, women who were capable of bearing children naturally held higher status and power, governing social order and wielding authority.\n\nMen, although stronger than women, were forced to please them under the system. To please them, they had to be physically attractive and have the ability to satisfy their emotional needs – they had to be good-looking, have a strong physique, be able to speak sweet nothings, and be skilled at seduction.\n\nIn terms of physical appearance, men who were slender and weak might be attractive to some women, but overall, men who were tall and well-built were more popular. In bed, they were also more able to satisfy women's needs.\n\nAs for women's physical appearance, the standards were also normal. As long as they had beautiful features, a curvy figure, and some charm and talent, they would be a perfect wife. And the Third Princess... she usually had a sulky and unattractive expression, but this time, her face was expressionless, and her beauty was suddenly revealed. Her eyes were raised slightly, and her beauty was almost too much to bear.\n\nThe young man was taken aback, and his compliment slipped out of his mouth without him realizing it. If he had said this to any other noblewoman, it would have been considered impertinent, but to the Third Princess, who enjoyed teasing men, it was just a pleasant surprise.", "elapsed": 10151.4824655056, "call": 635}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

The young man's heart was overjoyed, and he became even more attentive, carefully adjusting the princess's long hair.\n\nHowever, it wasn't until the grooming was almost finished that the teasing he had been expecting all day didn't come. The young man bit his lip, trying to probe cautiously, \"Your Highness... are you feeling unwell?\"\n\nAs a man and a servant, it was normal for him to worry about and comfort his princess. The three princesses had always liked being treated with gentle care in the past.\n\nBut today was different. The three princesses didn't show any signs of being upset, looking as usual, but somehow, she was cold towards him:\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe young man bit his lip, thinking carefully, and whispered softly, \"Your Highness, don't worry, Mi Xin is just a bit proud, he will eventually understand your goodness.\"\n\nYu Chu raised an eyebrow. Mi Xin was the son of the Chancellor's family. He was also the so-called beautiful young man in the story.\n\nHis noble status had bred him with a good temperament, and his appearance was handsome, with a slender and good-looking physique.\n\nIn Kyoto, there were countless girls who secretly admired him, but they were all afraid to approach him due to his status. They tried to flirt with him, but he was too proud and no one had been able to win him over yet.\n\nThe three princesses were also part of the army of admirers. Although she didn't dare to directly pressure the Chancellor's son to marry her, she would often use her status to implement her flirting plans. The result... was as expected.\n\nAs the infamous flower boy and fool in Kyoto, Mi Xin naturally despised her. He liked the Grand Princess, who was both beautiful and talented. Not the three princesses like her, who were idle and promiscuous.\n\nMi Xin had initially ignored her completely, but later, he had reluctantly agreed to the Grand Princess's plan and occasionally gave her a good face. - Even though he had never said a word of affection to her, the poor three princesses were already satisfied with his occasional good face.\n\nShe may have been promiscuous in the past, loving various handsome men. But later, she had genuinely fallen in love with Mi Xin.\n\nShe understood that Mi Xin didn't like her, and she had already decided to give up. But Mi Xin had agreed to the Grand Princess's request, occasionally showing concern for her, and rekindling her hope. In the end, he used this emotion to successfully kill her.\n\nHe said that he thought his fake smile and flattery were the greatest shame of his life.\n\nSo, the three princesses hated him. She had never hurt anyone, but her life and dignity had been trampled. So, she wanted revenge.\n\nChapter 183: The First Flower of the Female World (4)", "elapsed": 9623.81100153923, "call": 608}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

I don't even bother to let him know.\"\n\nShe looked at her beautiful face in the mirror, raised her lips, and smiled with a hint of uncertainty. In the previous few realms, the original owner's wishes were too gentle, and this realm is more in line with her intentions.\n\nThe young man behind her heard this and was stunned. He heard the Three Imperial Princess, who was always eager to be with Ye Mi Xin, say that she was lazy to let others know how good she was? The young man's face turned extremely strange.\n\nHer previous words were unintentional praise, and her later comfort was also a clever way of speaking. In fact, the true Three Imperial Princess has no good qualities... She even bragged about herself, saying it with such confidence.\n\nBut... the girl in the mirror had a face that was unparalleled in beauty, with eyebrows and eyes that were the epitome of elegance. She was lazily playing with a golden hairpin, and her small movements were so enticing that it made people's hearts itch. She even gave rise to a desire to please her.\n\nThe young man was shocked by his own thoughts and his face turned even redder. He bit his lip and slowly combed his hair. — Maybe the princess has been stimulated again.\n\nHe never thought that the Three Imperial Princess would really give up on Ye Mi Xin. Ye Mi Xin's beauty and status were unmatched, and the Three Imperial Princess's relentless pursuit of him was known throughout the city. It was unthinkable that she would give up. No one in Kyoto would believe it.\n\nHowever, as he thought about it, the young man couldn't help but feel a subtle sense of joy. If the Three Imperial Princess really gave up on that man, it would be a good thing.\n\nYe Mi Xin's status was too high, and if he married into the Imperial Princess's mansion, he would definitely be a strict husband.

At the rear of the airship, the operating magical furnace produced countless colorful particles, which were expelled through the airship's rear and looked like the majestic tail feathers of a phoenix. Combined with the surrounding white contrails, it resembled a painting drawn on the canvas of the sky.\n\nAs the airship descended, waves began to form on its belly, similar to a ship sailing on the sea, causing ripples in the sky. This was due to the presence of sacred auras in the surrounding atmosphere, which had an effect on the magical furnace, even though it didn't react with sacred magic.\n\nThis phenomenon indicated that they were close to their destination, the Sacred Domain. In fact, the massive, majestic building in front of them could be seen from the airship's windscreen. The Sacred Domain was not a single castle or church, but a large complex of buildings. The iconic building, the giant cathedral \"New Covenant Cathedral,\" stood tall, facing east.\n\nThis enormous structure, even featured on the coats of arms of the White Knights, was composed entirely of white rock, which had a subtle quality reminiscent of jade. Its beauty was captivating, whether viewed up close or from a distance. In addition to the white exterior, the building was adorned with numerous exquisite stained-glass windows, each one telling a mythological story through thousands of colored glass pieces. The windows' unique mystique elevated the overall beauty of the stories, allowing people to appreciate the myths and legends that had been passed down through the ages.\n\nAt the top of the cathedral, a massive cross stood tall, surrounded by a golden aura that seemed to have a physical presence. The edges of the aura appeared to be repeating a rhythmic contraction and expansion, like the keys of a piano. Although West didn't know what it was, the subtle vibrations emanating from the aura hinted that it might be one of the magical items set up by the White Knights to counter their enemies.\n\nAfter circling the Sacred Domain twice, the airship landed gently in a designated open training area.", "elapsed": 7560.647581338882, "call": 453}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

The fact that a cardinal came to greet him, a nobody, and even bowed - even if it was just a pretence - already showed the Vatican's sincerity.\n\nAfter seeing the cardinal's attitude, Nero behind Severus had frozen in place.\n\nThis also made Severus even more puzzled: what could these old men who always stayed in the Vatican, only busy with their prayers and rituals, want from him?\n\n\"You're too polite,\" Severus nodded in greeting, since others had given him face, he certainly couldn't show off his haughty and cold demeanor - that's not called being dignified, that's called being pretentious. Expressing good intentions in moderation is also a part of social etiquette.\n\n\"The Pope and the previous Pope have been waiting for you in the New Testament Church, please follow me there for now,\" the cardinal with an unknown name smiled with a foolish expression, accompanied by his chubby appearance, giving people a harmless impression. However, if someone really dared to treat him as harmless, that person would definitely be taken advantage of... How could someone become a cardinal and stand at the top of the Vatican without having any cunning?\n\n\"Thank you,\" Severus said nothing more.

Whether it's Jobs or Bill Gates, or Page and Brin, they all started from a garage.\n\nThe big companies in Silicon Valley that are worth billions of dollars all started from a small garage. Herral's Alchemy Workshop may not be a garage, but it's slightly bigger than one.\n\nJoesh spread a white paper on his desk, and a glowing ball floated beside him, dispelling the darkness around him. This is the lowest-level \"Light Magic\" spell, which is a basic spell that almost all magic users know. The original crystal stone for Light Magic has been replaced by Nolan, and it has become the most common lighting tool in Nolan.\n\nWith the light from the spell, Joesh had just finished making the poster for \"Beauty and the Beast\". Since he hasn't figured out how to import the image into his consciousness using the program, he could only draw the title on the white paper by hand, and then project the scene where Bella and the demon dance and look at each other onto the paper.\n\nAfter completing the poster, Joesh left the small room and went to the room where Herral displayed his finished products. The entire room was lit up by Light Magic, and Herral's magical machines also emitted a faint glow. The magical machines' runes projected a female wizard's portrait.\n\nHer eyes were filled with a faint blue magical glow, and her hands were filled with a surge of magical energy. The background behind her was a heavy rain, with silver and light gold hair flowing in the wind.\n\nJust by looking at the portrait, you can feel how powerful a wizard she is.\n\n\"Who is she?\"\n\nShiri walked out from behind the magical machine, holding a white paper with Joesh's original drawing on it.\n\n\"She's Gianna, Gianna Prodmor.\"", "elapsed": 7627.893397092819, "call": 485}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

Hilaria was not suited to be a magician at all!\n\nJaina simply told Hilaria some basic techniques for coloring and composition, and let Hilaria redraw the original draft on the magical machinery.\n\nIn the end, Hilaria's artwork was still a bit far from \"professional\", but at least it had entered the \"usable\" range.\n\nThe most important thing was that Hilaria's artwork was not influenced by this era, the paintings of this era were mainly oil paintings, and the style of the paintings was closer to the smile of the Mona Lisa, and the style of Chinese watercolor painting, this style of painting, Jaina had seen it in the White Jasmine Knight's theater, and heard White Jasmine Knight say that this painting was painted by an artist from a country called \"Great Summer\".\n\nRegardless of whether it was oil painting or watercolor painting, it was different from the modern CG style on Earth, but Jaina didn't find any \"retro\" feeling in Hilaria's artwork.\n\n\"You really haven't considered pursuing a career in painting in the future?\" \n\nJaina carefully examined Jaina's original painting, some small details and imperfections, but after Jaina's modifications, they were still acceptable.\n\nIf Hilaria continued to practice at this pace, Hilaria would definitely become an excellent game original painter.\n\n\"I... don't know.\"", "elapsed": 9346.64441561699, "call": 583}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

However, if she had to give up her career as a magician to focus on being a painter, Hiril would certainly not agree.\n\nAfter all, in this world, only powerful magicians stand at the top of the world, and Hiril has enough talent to become a powerful magician.\n\n\"I didn't ask you to give up your main profession, just make painting a living profession.\"\n\nJoushu gave Hiril the perfect answer. \"Living profession.\"\n\nHiril looked at the portrait of Giania, a woman who looked incredibly powerful as a mage. Perhaps, for Joushu, only the profession of painter was useful, as he had too many powerful people around him.\n\n\"Well, but one day,'my magic will tear you into pieces.'\"\n\nHiril quoted Giania's line to Joushu, which was written at the back of Giania's original manuscript.\n\nHowever, Joushu did not feel any sense of crisis, but rather, his eyes lit up at Hiril's words.\n\n\"Hiril, your words sound quite impressive.

The power of heaven and earth was too great, even for them.\n\nShen Yan and the others were no exception, and it was even more so for the disciples of the Magus Sect. Ji Li was also gazing up at the sky, thinking to herself, \"This spectacle is so grand, I wonder if Liu Xun can see it from somewhere else?\"\n\nAs soon as the light appeared, she immediately lowered her head and closed her eyes, feeling a searing pain in her eyes.\n\nEven the two sisters, who were sitting on a boulder at the back of the mountain, and the third brother, Zhuge Lifa, who was standing by the kitchen window, all chose to close their eyes.\n\nThe heavens were not to be trifled with!\n\nHowever, on the peak of the mountain, a man dressed in white, who looked like a middle-aged scholar, continued to gaze up at the sky. He was sipping a cup of hot tea, seemingly unaffected by the spectacle.\n\nThe man took a sip of his tea, his eyes fixed on the sky as he watched the scene unfold. He narrowed his eyes slightly, but his expression remained calm.\n\nTime: 3999 of the Tianchen Era.\n\nPublic test countdown.\n\nTen, nine, eight... three, two, one!\n\nLiu Xun opened his eyes, which had been tightly closed. The blinding light had dissipated, and the massive hole in the sky had disappeared, as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe world of cultivators was shaken, and it was later unclear who had coined the term \"Heaven's Collapse\" to describe the scene.\n\nFrom that day on, people on the Tianchen Continent began to notice that some individuals had undergone a transformation. These individuals were referred to as \"Aberrants.\"\n\nNo one suspected that they came from another world; instead, they believed that the Heaven's Collapse had caused them to change.\n\nIt was as if an invisible hand was manipulating something. It had given the player the identity of an Aberrant, rather than an Aberrant species.\n\nLiu Xun had thought that this world was real when he first arrived, but now everything seemed like a game. Or perhaps it was a combination of both?\n\nHe couldn't quite understand the situation.", "elapsed": 10077.455500125885, "call": 614}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

However, the imagined pain didn't come, and only her toes hurt a little. But the back of her head felt soft and fluffy.\n\nShe couldn't help but open her eyes, and she saw that Mo Ye was frowning with a look of discomfort.\n\nIt turned out that Mo Ye had automatically fallen to the ground and acted as a human cushion for her, so she didn't hit her head.\n\n\"Brother Mo, are you okay?\" Sweet Sweet didn't even check her own foot pain and immediately got up from his body, her small hand nervously feeling his chest, afraid that she had crushed his bones.\n\nMo Ye's eyes deepened, and he immediately grabbed her hand and stood up with her, his voice slightly hoarse. \"I'm fine.\"\n\nSweet Sweet finally let out a sigh of relief and immediately glared at the culprit. \"Summer, what do you mean by bullying me like this?\"\n\n\"I... didn't mean to... I just wanted to push her away and run,\" Summer said immediately, her face red with tears. She had only wanted to push Sweet Sweet away and run, but she didn't expect her to fall to the ground.\n\n\"You won't even say sorry?\" Mo Ye's cold voice echoed in the background.\n\nSummer's face became even more embarrassed, and she looked down at Sweet Sweet. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to.\"\n\nSweet Sweet didn't say whether she forgave her or not, and she pulled Mo Ye away. \"Brother Mo, the high jump has started. Let's go.\"\n\n\"The elementary school high jump participants, please report to the third sports field for preparation,\" the loudspeaker announced at the same time.\n\nThe elementary school high jump was a type of high jump where the athletes had to jump over a bar, which was the simplest type of high jump.

The beautiful eyebrows slightly furrowed, Night Cloud Creek didn't hesitate, she casually brushed her long hair and straightforwardly knocked away the Emperor's evil hand, replacing it with a posture of holding her arm, and a faint smile appeared: \"I prefer this kind.\"\n\n\"It's fine.\" The Emperor's evil hand retracted his gaze, and when he looked up, his aura also changed completely, from being romantic to being high and mighty, with a stern aura!\n\nThis man is indeed very handsome!\n\n\"Let's buy you a suit first.\" The clothing store was right next to them, and the Emperor's evil hand walked in and was immediately surrounded by sales staff. These people were accustomed to the elite of the upper class and could easily tell the Emperor's evil hand's status, but Night Cloud Creek... sports wear and sneakers? Is she another climber?\n\n\"One suit.\" The Emperor's evil hand coldly threw out a sentence, and suddenly Night Cloud Creek's eyes were filled with several more clothes.\n\nThe sales staff were busy attending to them, and Night Cloud Creek could only try on one suit after another. However, no matter what clothes she wore, she looked good in them. With a slender waist and a curved buttocks, she would look beautiful in anything.\n\nNight Cloud Creek didn't seem to notice any difference. After all, they were all dresses, the only difference being the color and length, and what else was different?\n\n\"Miss, you look good in any of the dresses, it's really hard to choose!\" \n\n\"Yes, yes, it's really hard to choose, why not buy them all?\"\n\nBuy them all? Has she gone crazy? It's just a meal, do you think it's a catwalk?\n\nSeeing that the sales staff were at a loss, the Emperor's evil hand simply stood up and picked out a dark-colored starry night dress from the pile of clothes and handed it to Night Cloud Creek. \"This one.\"\n\n\"This one?\" Night Cloud Creek took it and scanned it, and apart from having some sparkling things, it was still just a dress.\n\nBut she could only put it on and come out of the dressing room.\n\nIn that instant, even the sales staff didn't know what to say.\n\nThis dress really suits Night Cloud Creek! It's like it was tailor-made for her!\n\nThe deep blue color of the dress was like the ocean, with the color gradually lightening from top to bottom, and the hem was like a shallow beach, with a thin veil draped over the outside of the dress, and the fragments of the veil sparkled like stars, shining with every movement, and it was breathtakingly beautiful!\n\n\"How beautiful!\"\n\n\"It looks like a sea spirit of the night!\"\n\n\"It feels mysterious and beautiful!\"\n\nAlthough she was not fond of this profession, a beautiful woman is a beautiful woman.\n\nEveryone was satisfied with this dress, but the Emperor's evil hand scanned it and then furrowed his brow: \"Take it off.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Night Cloud Creek was curious, didn't everyone say it was beautiful?\n\nThe Emperor's evil hand's face turned even more difficult to look at.", "elapsed": 10937.06382060051, "call": 653}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

If you pull it down a bit more, it's no different from not wearing a top. And the back, it's so exposed, what are you trying to entice? So, \"change this one!\"\nThe emperor's face turned ugly again as he handed over another dress, but Night Cloud Creek was speechless and changed.\n\nThis time, the long dress was surprisingly average, with a high collar design that even covered her neck. The emperor nodded in satisfaction: \"This one.\"\n\nThis dress? The waitresses all said it wasn't as good-looking as the starry night dress. But since the boss said so, they could only arrange to collect payment. However, the card being handed over was the one they had been eyeing, the young man who was a high-society darling.\n\n\"Swipe the card.\"\n\"What?\" The waitress looked at the emperor, but the man had already pulled out his card. Night Cloud Creek directly said, \"A dress, I can still afford it.\"\nThe emperor gave her a mysterious glance, but didn't say anything, putting away the card.\n\nThe waitress's mind was about to explode. Afford it? The cheapest dress here was over a million, and only the wealthy could afford it? So, this young woman wasn't the young man's mistress, but a high-society woman herself?\n\nIn that instant, the waitress couldn't help but feel a sense of respect. After all, in their line of work, it was rare to meet women who could afford to buy clothes here.\n\nIt turned out that the young woman was from a wealthy family! Impressive!\n\nAfter changing into the dress, Night Cloud Creek slightly adjusted her hairstyle and followed the emperor into the dining hall.\n\nThe young woman's advantage was that she didn't need to wear makeup, and her skin was translucent and delicate, with a rosy lip and white skin that was as fragile as a just-ripened apple, and was as charming as a ripe fruit.\n\n\"Hello, sir, how many people?\" The waiter was enthusiastic, but the emperor turned around and grabbed Night Cloud Creek's hand, stubbornly holding it in his arm.\n\n\"You'll get used to it.\" The man whispered, his voice full of allure. Be my woman, the emperor's woman.\n\nFine, get used to it. After all, when the time comes to meet the parents, it's better to be natural and not reveal too much. Night Cloud Creek calmly hooked her arm around the man's and sat down.\n\nThe dining hall was crowded, even with the expensive food, the customers were endless. Many people looked over, including some who recognized the emperor. The upper-class circle was so big, and the emperor's heir was so powerful, once you saw him, you would never forget.\n\n\"That's probably the emperor's son?\"\n\"Who is the woman on the other side? Is there a young lady from a big family like that?\"\n\"She's pretty, and she looks good with the emperor.\"", "elapsed": 9956.522007226944, "call": 623}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

Can that prove she's definitely the Emperor's girlfriend?\n\nExactly, that woman is not even worthy of the Emperor.\n\nThe man's gaze fell on Night Cloud, full of admiration, while the woman's gaze fell on Night Cloud, full of disdain.\n\nHow can she possibly compare to the daughters of the top families? Maybe she's just trying to climb the social ladder and come here to freeload?\n\nDoes she even know etiquette?\n\nEtiquette? Sorry, I really do know it. Night Cloud raised her head to scan the surroundings, and then hooked her mouth into a smile. She elegantly picked up her knife and fork. Her posture, full marks! Her demeanor, full marks!\n\nShe's not unfamiliar with the etiquette of high society. Whether she's worthy of the Emperor or not, no one can belittle her. Because if you know it, she knows it too. Even if she doesn't know it, she has a brain and can still learn. The petite woman raised a haughty smile, lazily scanning the jealous faces around her.

How envious!\n\n\"Good.\" Night Cloud smiled, scanning the Emperor's face. What is he doing? It's just a contract, right? Does he really have to go all out?\n\nBut the Emperor put down his knife and fork, looking relaxed and waiting for the music to start. Whether it's a contract or not, this is what he wants to do for Night Cloud.\n\nThe violin's sound was melodious and enchanting, complementing the dim atmosphere of the restaurant.\n\nIf it were just any ordinary girl sitting here, she would probably be overwhelmed, but Night Cloud rubbed her temples. She thought that being the Emperor's woman must be exhausting, because this woman has to be all-rounded.

Is it a new version of the modified phone?\" Song Shuhang leaned over to A Sixteen's phone and asked.\n\nElder Henghuo: \"No, we are currently in Bai Dao's secret base on Mars.

There are two D-level net fighters leading the team, and 14 E-level personnel responsible for guarding the southern transportation hub, and then there are many police officers waiting here, which is to say that they are very serious about this matter.\n\nLu Shu thought about the two cultivators who encountered misfortune on the bridge: although the Heavenly Net has made very thorough preparations, it's been set up a long time ago, but the key is that they don't have any awakened people to frequently practice with.\n\nJust look at Liang Che's treatment, which is to be knocked out with a sedative and taken away later, and who knows if he will be absorbed into the Heavenly Net later, which is already very humane.\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that the situation is under control means that some of the Heavenly Net's combat personnel may not have experienced any real battles. They work in perfect coordination, but they will also make mistakes.\n\nThis is all normal.\n\nIf, in the early stages of spiritual energy recovery, a team suddenly emerges that is capable of facing awakened people and cultivators alike, with rich combat experience, who knows what they were practicing with before?\n\nIn the army, there is also the concept of training for real war, and those who have experienced a baptism by fire are considered seasoned veterans.\n\nHowever, now it's a peaceful era.\n\nPerhaps there are some old hands on the border line who have been selected for the Heavenly Net, but this proportion is probably negligible compared to the entire army.\n\nLu Shu's guess was not wrong, those who have truly experienced fire and blood and have the talent, have long since become a coveted resource. Intelligent people will understand that whether or not someone has experienced the test of blood is a completely different state.\n\nAt this time, the Heavenly Net personnel who were left behind and chased after them have caught up, and Lu Shu can only become more stealthy and prepare to activate the Starlight Shawl escape mode at any time.\n\nThe power-type awakened person is hiding behind the building facade with his two companions, not daring to show his head, fearing that there may be snipers hiding here, waiting to take his life with a single shot.\n\nHowever, he can't just sit back and wait to be surrounded by the approaching cultivators, because if he really lets them surround him, he might really be doomed to ascend to heaven, knowing that the team has two D-level cultivators!", "elapsed": 10315.537287712097, "call": 637}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

He bit his tongue, spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood: \"Go!\"\n\nThe long sword, now stained with blood, shot towards the fugitive like a meteor. The cultivator's body suddenly weakened, as if this technique came at a cost. However, he didn't have time to think about it now. If he didn't use his trump card, he might let the fugitive escape.\n\nAlthough they were cultivators, they had all received the education of protecting their homeland before they started their cultivation journey. Now, these three fugitives had committed an unforgivable crime. If they let the fugitive escape, it would be a lifelong shame.\n\nThis sword strike was beyond his capabilities, a desperate attempt to save the situation. Even if he didn't get hurt, his strength would be greatly reduced, and his internal energy would be severely damaged. He would never be able to progress again in this life.\n\nThis sword strike was like a thunderbolt, piercing through the air and heading straight for the fugitive. The blue meteor illuminated the dark alley, shining on the worn-out walls and the broken streetlights. The fugitive's terrified eyes were filled with a desperate fear.\n\nMost bullets can exceed the speed of sound, but it's hard to see them break through the sound barrier because everything happens inside the barrel.\n\nWhen a bullet flies through the air with water vapor, its speed slows down below the speed of sound. At this point, a unique fog forms around the bullet in the high supersonic range. As it slows down to the middle supersonic range, the fog disappears.\n\nHowever, the blue meteor in the air formed a fine sonic cone, and a white wave of pressure radiated outward. Although the meteor was not as fast as a bullet, its impact was immense.\n\nD-level cultivators are known for their ability to dodge heat-based weapons, not because they are faster than bullets, but because they are faster than most heat-based weapon users in terms of aiming and firing speed.\n\nThe blue meteor arrived in an instant, and the fugitive barely had time to dodge before it struck him. However, the D-level cultivator's physical strength was indeed powerful, and the blue meteor only pierced through the fugitive's left side, not even breaking through. It was stuck tightly in his body.", "elapsed": 8059.471075296402, "call": 498}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

However, the physical body of a D-level awakened person was indeed far superior to that of an ordinary person, and even after being hit by this sword, he did not fall into a life-threatening state, but instead struggled to get up and continue fleeing.\n\nAt this moment, when the wall collapsed, a figure in a starry cloak appeared behind it, covering his entire body. \n\n\"If I say I was just out for a walk, you probably won't believe me, right?\"\n\nEveryone was somewhat uncertain and suspicious, as no one would believe that a person would suddenly appear behind the wall, especially one who was clearly an awakened person, wrapped in a starry power. \n\nThe situation in the scene suddenly became bizarre, with Lyu Shu in front, the fugitive in the middle, and the practitioners of the Heavenly Net behind, closing in on him in a fan-shaped formation.\n\nThe fugitive let out a fierce roar and tried to break through from Lyu Shu's side, as he had no time to think anymore. As long as the person in front of him was still alive, he would have to kill him, or else he would be walking into a dead end.\n\nLyu Shu's position was too awkward, even if he expressed his intention not to intervene, the fugitive would still be wary of Lyu Shu's potential sneak attack from behind when they passed each other.\n\nSo the fugitive made the only choice he had, which was to kill.\n\nHe burst into a state of full power, with blood surging to his entire body, and suddenly unleashed his full strength.\n\n\"It's not good, he's going to awaken again!\"\n\n\"Kill him on the spot!\"\n\n\"Grab that suspicious person!\"\n\nAt this moment, the fugitive had already jumped up and swung a punch at Lyu Shu, and no one had expected that this fugitive, who had awakened three times in a row, would suddenly show signs of awakening again at this moment!\n\nIf he really awakened, no one knew what would happen, a C-level power awakened person? What kind of existence would that be?\n\nAnd the person who appeared behind the wall could not be confirmed to be helping the fugitive, otherwise it would be a case of mutual slaughter. However, the person who appeared out of nowhere must be brought back to be questioned.\n\nThe fugitive's power was rapidly increasing, and his wounds were healing, with the sword inside him seeming to grow out of his body. The wounds had stopped bleeding.\n\nThe practitioners of the Heavenly Net were shocked and stunned, as the battles of power awakened people always had a sense of simplicity and directness to them, as if everything could be broken with brute force.\n\nThe person on the other side... might die?

Since he chose to come, Lu Shu should have the confidence to retreat unscathed.\n\nIn an instant, his feet connected with the ground, his legs connected with his waist, his waist connected with his arms, and his arms connected with his strength!\n\nLu Shu's punch was fierce and domineering, like a wild beast's instinct, and it struck the approaching thug with a downward motion. There was a loud crack, and a bone-crushing sound echoed from the thug's arm, like a soul-stirring voice in the quiet night.\n\nThe thug, who was stronger than Lu Shu, surprisingly lost to a single punch!\n\nThis was the secret to the power of force that Li Xuan had taught Lu Shu, and this was the fighting technique that Lu Shu had formed through his daily sweat and toil.\n\nAt this moment, although Lu Shu was still an E-level cultivator in the star chart, his physical strength had indeed crossed the threshold of the early stage of D-level!

The star chart then quietly hovered around Lu Shu once more, and he no longer hesitated. Lu Shu kicked the fugitive back into the crowd and then disappeared into the darkness of the alleyway, easily jumping onto the rooftop and vanishing.\n\nEveryone was shocked, watching the thug struggle to get up and continue fleeing, driven by the desire to survive.

After all, not everyone can be selfless enough to ignore their own future.\n\nHowever, he couldn't help but think deeply, the other party's sword techniques were extremely skilled, completely unlike the need for themselves to suffer a 1000 damage to release a strike. Could this be a C-level cultivator?\n\nEven if he really went up to fight with his life on the line, could he leave the other party behind? He needed to use a desperate attack, but the other party had already used it skillfully!

How did he get wanted? He's killed Not Laughing that many times, didn't he just go to prison and confess? If we all chase after him, won't his identity be exposed? What's the point of him wearing a mask before?\"\n\nWindrunner:...\n\n\"Tell me!\" The Unsworn Sword's current anxious expression was a far cry from his calm demeanor in the guild.\n\n\"I...

The Unsworn Sword scanned the area and saw many leaders from other guilds in Cloud City. He could guess their intentions - they all wanted to befriend this ruthless person and possibly even bring them into their own guild. The Unsworn Sword had the same intention, but for now, he didn't need to think too much about it. With so many people, it was hard to say who would ultimately get their hands on him!\n\nThe Unsworn Sword turned his head to search for the wanted poster. The information about the Masked Assassin was prominently displayed at the top: PK value 15, ID 27149.\n\nAt the same time, the people still in the hall didn't seem to be in a hurry to take on the task. They all thought that Not Laughing would eventually surrender. The surrender area was also in this hall, so they all kept a close eye on the players entering and leaving, their eyes lighting up when they saw a mage, only to be disappointed again.\n\n\"Why hasn't he surrendered?

They both exclaimed in surprise and laughed, saying strange things.\n\nThe three aunties were also surprised, and one of them exclaimed, \"This is the potato! It's really big! And it's still got dirt on it!\"\n\nLian Fengzhou smiled and thought to herself, \"This is still small, I'm sure it's limited by the seed itself and the planting technique. If it were in modern times, even a grown-up's fist-sized one wouldn't be rare.\"\n\n\"I don't think it looks like a potato at all!\" Lian Che examined it carefully.\n\n\"I wonder if it's edible or not!\" Lian Fengqing said in a clear voice.\n\nThe three aunties looked at each other and smiled, with one of them saying, \"I was just thinking the same thing!\"\n\nLian Fengzhou then said, \"Wait until next year, and you'll have plenty to eat! This is a seed, you can't eat it!

We'll probably need them later, and just walking will not only be more tiring, but also waste time!\"\n\nLian Fengzhou thought for a moment and it was exactly this reasoning. Not only did they need to buy a donkey, but also a cow, and many agricultural tools needed to be replaced. All of these would have to be planned out in the end!\n\nHowever, for now, it was still most urgent to buy the land first! After buying the land, they could then consider buying other things according to the size of the land.\n\n\"I think the same way!\" Lian Fengzhou said with a smile. \"After we've looked at the land, let's go to the livestock market and ask about the prices over the next few days! If the prices are reasonable, we'll buy them. Buying livestock in winter is much cheaper than in spring! We'll just have to work harder to take care of them over the winter!\"\n\nLian Ze was very happy to hear this and said with a smile, \"Sister, our family is also going to buy a donkey and a donkey cart? I never even dared to think about it! Sister, don't worry, when the time comes, I and Chede will take good care of the donkey!\"\n\n\"Oh, won't that interfere with your practice?\" Lian Fengzhou teased, raising an eyebrow. The three of them laughed together.\n\nLian Ze had gotten up before dawn to practice today, saying that he would do so from now on. He was indeed working harder to learn martial arts, and he wanted to protect her and protect this family in the future.\n\n\"Sister!\" Lian Ze scratched his head, looking very embarrassed, and then spoke seriously, \"No, I also want to help out at home! They're still young, and can't burden you alone!\"\n\n\"Really, my good brother!\" Lian Fengzhou laughed.\n\nThe three of them went into the city and first went to the money exchange to exchange a 1,000-ounce silver note for seven 100-ounce notes, and the remaining 300 ounces was exchanged for 50 ounces, 10 ounces, and some small change, and they also exchanged 10 ounces of small silver coins to carry with them.\n\nBecause Big House Village is not too far from the county town, they directly went to the county town to find the land guarantor. If it was a remote area, they would go to the nearest town to handle this kind of business.\n\nThe three of them asked around and found out that the land guarantor, Liu Jia, was at home, so they went to a pastry shop to buy two boxes of pastries.\n\nLiu Jia just happened to be at home and saw the three strangers coming to his door, so he knew it was business. He smiled and greeted them warmly, \"What are your surnames, gentlemen? Are you here to buy land? Ha ha, please come in and sit down!\"\n\nLiu Jia spoke to A Jian, assuming that A Jian was the one in charge. A Jian nodded and introduced himself, and then said, \"We're looking for mountain land, and we don't know if there's any suitable one.\"\n\nLian Fengzhou added, \"We're from Big House Village, can you take a look at the land in Big House Village or nearby villages that are for sale?\"", "elapsed": 12638.297555208206, "call": 718}, {"prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful translator and only output the result.

However, he still had a job to do, and his smile remained. He asked, \"I'll go get the ledger to take a look. How many do you want to buy?\"\n\nAs he spoke, he went into the inner room to get the ledger. Lian Fangzhou smiled and said, \"About two thousand mu.\"\n\nLiu Jia, who was just coming out of the inner room, suddenly widened his eyes and looked at Lian Fangzhou in surprise. \"How many?\" he asked.\n\n\"Two thousand mu. Do you have that much available? If not, can you help me think of a way?\" Lian Fangzhou smiled and clearly explained to Liu Jia.\n\nLiu Jia was stunned for a moment, then looked at A Jian for help. \"Explain the details to Miss Lian,\" A Jian said with a smile, not understanding much about farming.\n\nLiu Jia moved his lips, slapped his head, and sat down, laughing. \"I've been a land guardian for half a lifetime, and I've really misjudged this! You want that much land, I'm afraid there may not be any!\"\n\nLiu Jia carefully looked at the ledger, and soon his eyes lit up with a smile. \"There's a suitable one here!\"\n\nThis land, which the wealthy Mr. Wang of the Big House Village wanted to sell because it was unproductive and troublesome, was about 160 mu. It was not far from here, and belonged to Yang Yewang of Yang Family Village, with about 380 mu. His son was in urgent need of a large sum of money, and the family had sold a lot of land. This was one of the plots!\n\nIn the middle of this large piece of land, about 280 mu belonged to four households. If you wanted to connect it all, you could talk to the owners about buying or exchanging it, but you would likely have to take a loss on the price.\n\nThe remaining 660 mu was uncultivated land without an owner. If you wanted to buy it, you would have to pay the village a reclamation fee and then pay the official price for the land sale to the government, which would cost a lot of money. However, there was a discount - you wouldn't have to pay taxes for the first three years.\n\nIn total, this would be about 1,500 mu.", "elapsed": 13146.20587015152, "call": 521}]
